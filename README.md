# Overview
This pipeline implements the WES workflow used in identifying the novel c.871G>C (p.Gly291Arg) variant in the SLC19A3 gene, as described in "Early Infantile Thiamine Transporter-2 Deficiency with Epileptic Spasmsâ€”A Phenotypic Spectrum with a Novel Mutation" (Mishra et al., 2021). The workflow enables sensitive detection of rare pathogenic variants in clinical samples, with particular emphasis on homozygous variants in consanguineous families.
